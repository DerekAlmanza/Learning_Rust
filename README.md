# Learning Rust

A repository created for learn and review the basic concepts for Rust. This code is fully documented.

* Hello. Basic lessons:
  * Write and run a Hello, world! program using rustc directly
  * Create and run a new project using the conventions of Cargo
  
***
  
* Guess Game. Basic lessons:

  * Introduce you to many new Rust concepts like:
    * let
    * match
  * And the basic use of:
    * Methods
    * Associated functions
    * External crates
    
***
 
 * Common Programming Concepts.
 
   In this lesson we learn the general programming concepts like:
     * Variables and mutability: There are two kinds of variables; 
       * Inmutable variables: They are declared as `let`.
       * Mutable variables: They are declared as `let mut` and their value will can change.
     * Constants: The constants never change their value.
     * Shadowing: Use the same variable name repeatdly for different uses. 
     * Data types: To name a few types are;
       * Integer types.
       * Float types.
       * Numeric operations.
       * Boolean types.
       * Char types.
     * Functions.
     * Control flows: We decide wether run or not run our code depending of circunstances, the most common structures are:
       * If: An if expression allows you branch your code depending on conditions.
       * Loop: The loop keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever until you explicitly tell    it to stop.
       * While: It’s often useful for a program to evaluate a condition within a loop. While the condition is true, the loop runs.
       * For: It's useful to loop over the elements of a collection.
